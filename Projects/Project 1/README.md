# Project 1 - Bible Text & Locations Application
		

This project is a single page web application that uses the Google Maps API to display the locations that exist in each chapter of the Bible, along with the text of each chapter. To run the application, download the files locally, and use any IDE (preferably VS Code) to run the application. You will need to provide your own  Google Maps API in the index.html file in the script tag to run the application with all its functionality

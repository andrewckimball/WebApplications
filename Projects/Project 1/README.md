**Learning Experience - Project 1**

I enjoyed working on this project. I found the videos to be extremely helpful in learning how to apply what we have been studying the past few weeks in class to a real project. I learned a lot from studying the code structure that Dr. Liddle employed thorughout this project. I also felt like I learned a lot on my own while implementing the extra requirements that were not covered in the videos. Overall, this was a great experience.
